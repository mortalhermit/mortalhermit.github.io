<p><em>One should never truly desire something; for if they do, they’ll get it, but they’ll get it in such a way that there would be no meaning left in it anymore.</em></p>
<p>I am now an old man who can’t walk across two rooms. It is thus with great effort that I recall this long, long tale. It’s a story of my adventures in the Church (don’t worry, it’s not what you think). Back then, I was 25 and I worked at the local college as a computer science historian and part-time teacher. Allow me to start on the morning of the day when I met the Mortal Hermit.</p>
<hr />
<p>The year was 2052, and it was still raining.</p>
<p>I woke up to the sound of rain and thanked God for my MacBook Pro. I was a minimalist (I still am), and it’s pretty much the only thing other than the mattress that you’d’ve found in my living room. My daily routine back then was to make myself coffee and an omelet, and head out to work, where I’d check my mails, take a couple of lectures, go to the library to read papers and articles, and finally hang out with my friends.</p>
<p>But that was a Sunday. On Sundays, I used to roam around searching for old stuff, or if it were rainy, play FIFA. Who would’ve thought that one day it’d be clouds that allowed you to play football, let alone play football on a MacBook?</p>
<p>Anyways, as I connected to start the game, a routine I knew all too well enough to get wrong, something surprising happened. Instead of the game login screen, this message popped up:</p>
<p><code>“Do not touch this button.”</code></p>
<p>Pretty obviously, below it was a circular, deep red button on a grey rectangular boxed block background. As most of the 25-year-old CS historians would know, it was probably malware, and I should’ve tried reconnecting and reloading, and not touched it. As most of the 25-year-old CS historians, I did.</p>
<p>As soon as I touched it, I was greeted with another message, with a similar button:</p>
<p><code>“Do you really want to touch this button?”</code></p>
<p>If that was the only thing that had happened, I wouldn’t have been surprised at all. It’d be a simple trap that tries to lure you through your curiosity. These things had gone out of fashion long ago, even then.</p>
<p>But after I touched the button, I somehow felt lighter. I know it sounds crazy, and I couldn’t believe myself either, but it felt as if something was pulling me upwards, or as if gravity itself had reduced somehow.</p>
<p>Of course, I pressed it again. Yet another one, but this time with a slight change:</p>
<p><code>“Do you really, really want to touch this button?”</code></p>
<p>And again, I felt yet lighter. I reckon I liked the sensation and got carried away. I did this several more times, and faced this:</p>
<p><code>“Do you really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really want to touch this button?”</code></p>
<p>By then, I was already feeling around half my weight. I needed to get to the bottom of this. This loop would end somewhere, right? Just about when I was getting ideas to write a script to do so, at the same time rapidly pressing the button again and again, I reached the point of complete weightlessness.</p>
<p>It was at that point that I lost consciousness.</p>
